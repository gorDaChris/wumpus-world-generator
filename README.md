What does this program do?
> Generates valid/solvable Wumpus World boards to test agents/bots.

What is the Wumpus World problem?
> Given grids of varying sizes (usually 4x4), how can we program an agent to autonomously find the gold?
> Each "grid"/"board" has one agent, one gold, one Wumpus, and x pits.

What are the rules of the Wumpus World problem?
> Each square within a grid that the agent explores gives the agent a breeze, stench, and/or glitter flag.
> Breeze = an adjacent square has a pit.
> Stench = an adjacent square has a Wumpus.
> Glitter = an adjacent square has gold.

What is significant about this generator?
> Even if a human can discern a clear path for the agent to follow for the gold, it is NOT always possible for the agent to find the gold given the rules of the Wumpus World!
